## Getting a copy of the collection

The collection usually comes with two files: a collection file (.postman_collection) and an environment file (.postman_environment). As the name suggests, the collection file houses the various Kona API requests. Environmental variables such as API endpoint to target, client ID & secret, etc. that are commonly used by the API requests are all stored in the environment file.

1. Click on the file you need.
2. Click on the Raw button near the top right of the file.
3. When the raw text appears, right click on it and select "Save As" to save it to your local machine.

To import the collection file to Postman

2.  Choose the collection file (e.g. KonaAPI.json.postman_collection) from where ever you saved it.
